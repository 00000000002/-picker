      OKLCH is a new way to encode colors (likeÂ hex, RGBA or HSL).

      - Has native support in browsers.
      - Can encode more colors for modern screens (P3, Rec2020, and beyond).
      - In contrast [with HSL], has always predictable contrast after color transformation.
      - In contrast [with LCH and Lab] has no [hue shift] on chroma changes.
      - Provides great a11y on palette generation.
