      LCH is a new way to encode colors (like hex, RGBA, or HSL):

      - LCH has native browser support.
      - It can encode more colors for modern screens
        (P3, Rec. 2020, and beyond).
      - [Unlike HSL], OKLCH always has predictable contrast
        after color transformation.

      But Lab is LCH have [hue shift] on chroma changes. [Oklab and OKLCH]
      were created to solve this problem.
