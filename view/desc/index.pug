    OKLCH is a new way to encode colors (like hex, RGBA, or HSL):

    - OKLCH has native browser support.
    - It can encode more colors for modern screens (P3, Rec. 2020, and beyond).
    - [Unlike HSL], OKLCH always has predictable contrast
      after color transformation.
    - In contrast [with LCH and Lab], no [hue shift] on chroma changes.
    - Provides great a11y on palette generation.
