OKLab is a new way to encode colors:

* It is natively supported by [CSS Colors 4].
* Has support for P3 colors and any future monitors with new colors.
* Allow to predictably change the colors. This is very useful
  for native color transformations by `color(from â€¦)` from [CSS Colors 5].
  * In contrast with HSL it has predictable contrast for all colors with
    the same `L`.
  * In contrast with Lab it has no hue shift in blue on chrome changes.
