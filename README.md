OKLCH is a new way to encode colors (likeÂ hex, RGBA, or HSL):

- OKLCH has native browser support.
- It can encode more colors for modern screens (P3, Rec. 2020, and beyond).
- [Unlike HSL], OKLCH always has predictable contrast
  after color transformation.
- In contrast [with LCH and Lab], no [hue shift] on chroma changes.
- Provides great a11y on palette generation.
